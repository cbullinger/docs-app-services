.. important:: Disable Development Mode for Production Apps

   :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` is *not* intended for production
   use. Ensure that you disable Development Mode before you make your app
   accessible in a production environment. Once you disable Development Mode,
   :ref:`schema versioning <schema-versioning>` is automatically enabled for
   eligible apps.
