To use Atlas Device Sync you must define your data model in two formats:

- **App Services Schema**: A server-side schema which defines your
  data in BSON. Device Sync uses the App Services schema to convert your data
  to MongoDB documents and enforce validation and synchronize data between client
  devices and Atlas.

- **Client Object Model**: The client-side object model defined using the Atlas Device SDKs.
  Each SDK defines the object model in its own language-specific way.
  The SDKs use this model to store data in Realm database
  and synchronize data with Device Sync.

The App Services schema and Realm Object Schema must be consistent with each other
to sync data using Device Sync.

You can also sync data between clients using different Atlas Device SDKs,
as long as they implement the same Realm Object Schema. These Realm Object Schemas
must all be consistent with the App Services schema as well.

For example, you have an iOS app and an Android app with their Realm Object Schemas
defined using the Realm Swift SDK and the Realm Kotlin SDK, respectively.
Both these mobile applications sync data using the same App Services App with Device Sync.
The Swift SDK schema and the Kotlin SDK schema must both be consistent
with the same App Services schema.

Create a Data Model
-------------------

You can create your Device Sync data model in a few ways.

If you already have data in Atlas, you can generate an App Services schema
by sampling that data. You can then generate a Realm Object Schema for each Atlas Device SDK.

If you prefer to develop your Realm Object Schema using the Atlas Device SDKs first,
use Development Mode. When you use Development Mode, Device Sync automatically
generates an App Services schema when you sync data from a client using an Atlas Device SDK.

For more information on these approaches to modeling data,
refer to :ref:`create-sync-schema`.

Update a Data Model
-------------------

When developing an application using Atlas Device Sync, you may need to make changes
to your data model. This means you also need to update your App Services schema
and Realm Object Schema.

For more information on how to perform the different types of data model changes,
refer to :ref:`Update a Data Model <synced-schema-overview>`.

Data Model Mapping
------------------

To learn more about how the Realm Object Schemas map to the App Services schemas
when using Development Mode, refer to :ref:`Data Model Mapping <sync-data-model-mapping>`.
