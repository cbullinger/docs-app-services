.. TODO: Update [DATE TBD] 

When developing an application using Atlas Device Sync, you may need to make 
changes to your Device Sync data model. For example,
you might need a new object type or decide that an optional property should be 
required.

In general, we refer to data model updates in the following terms: 

- *What type of change are you making?* 

  We broadly categorize changes to a Device Sync data model
  as being either breaking or non-breaking. Breaking changes, such as changing
  the data type of an existing property, are considered destructive and require
  additional handling to apply. These are discussed in more detail below, or you
  can check out the :ref:`breaking-change-quick-reference` section on this page. 

- *Where are you making the change?* 

  Because the Device Sync data model consists of a client-side SDK object model
  and a server-side App Services schema, we distinguish between making changes
  to the client side (updating the SDK object models defined in your client
  code) or the server side (updating the collection schema through the App
  Services UI or Admin API). Regardles of where you make your
  changes, though, you must apply those same changes to the other side to ensure
  both sides remain consistent. The implications of where you make your changes are discussed in more detail below.

- *Is Development Mode or schema versioning enabled?* 

  When enabled for your app, the following Device Sync features can simplify how you update your data model:  
  
  - **Development Mode:** Development Mode is a Device Sync configuration setting. When enabled, you can make breaking changes from the client side, and App Services automatically handles updating the server-side schema. Apps must be created after September 13, 2023 and meet a minimum Device SDK version. For more information, refer to :ref:`update-data-model-development-mode`.
  - **Schema Versioning:** Schema versioning lets you manage incremental changes
    to your data model. You can make schema versioning changes to your
    server-side schema, and App Services automatically handles updating the
    client-side model to the new version. Apps must be created after [DATE TBD]. For more information, refer to :ref:`<update-data-model-production-apps>`.

.. TODO: update
  


.. _non-breaking-changes-overview:

Non-Breaking Changes
--------------------

**Non-breaking changes** are additive changes that don't require any additional
handling to apply. Non-breaking changes maintain compatibility with your
existing data model rather than "breaking" it, which means that old clients can
continue to sync data. 

You can make these changes in your server-side App Services schema
or in your client-side SDK object model without additional handling, unless
otherwise noted

.. - Adding a new object type or property
.. - Adding a default value on an existing property
.. - Removing an existing object type or property (when made from
..   the client side)

.. _schema-versioning-changes-overview:

Schema Versioning Changes
-------------------------

**Schema versioning changes** are destructive changes that create a new
compatible schema version instead of "breaking" your existing data model. When you deploy a schema versioning change, App Services increments the schema version and automatically handles upgrading the client-side model to the new version.

.. TODO: confirm 

Currently, schema versioning changes *must* be made from the server side. 
.. If schema versioning is disabled for your app, these are considered breaking changes. 

.. - Removing an existing object type or property 
.. - Changing whether an existing property is optional or required

If schema versioning is disabled for your app, schema versioning changes are
considered breaking changes. To learn more about schema versioning, refer to
:ref:`update-data-model-production-apps`.

.. _breaking-changes-overview:

Breaking Changes
----------------

**Breaking changes** are destructive changes that "break" your data model. These
changes require additional handling to apply to ensure that clients
can continue to connect and sync data. To learn more about manually handling breaking changes, refer to
:ref:`migrate-schema-partner-collection`.


- If you have schema versioning enabled, breaking changes create a new incompatible schema version (refer to the :ref:`breaking-changes-schema-versioning-overview` section on this page).

.. Breaking changes include:

.. - Removing an existing object type or property (if schema versioning is disabled)
.. - Changing whether an existing property is optional or required (if schema versioning is disabled)
.. - Renaming an existing object type or property
.. - Changing the data type of an existing property

.. include:: /includes/note-breaking-changes-sync-terminated.rst

.. _breaking-changes-development-mode-overview:

Breaking Changes with Development Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Development Mode is enabled in your app, you can make breaking
changes to your client-side object model, and App Services automatically
updates your server-side schema. For more information on Development Mode and how to enable it in your app, refer to :ref:`sync-settings`.  

.. Eligible apps must be created after September 13, 2023 and meet the minimum Device
.. SDK version, as noted in :ref:`<update-data-model-development-mode-prerequisites>`.

To learn how to make breaking changes with Development Mode, refer to :ref:`update-data-model-development-mode`.

.. include:: /includes/note-dev-mode-production.rst

.. _breaking-changes-schema-versioning-overview:

Breaking Changes with Schema Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When schema versioning is enabled in your app, breaking changes can create a new
schema version. This new version is incompatible with any previous schemas, and
clients *must* upgrade to the new schema version to continue syncing data.

Regardless, breaking changes are still considered breaking when schema
versioning is enabled and should be avoided if possible.  

To learn about schema versioning, refer to :ref:`update-data-model-production-apps`.

.. _breaking-change-quick-reference:

Data Model Changes: Quick Reference
-----------------------------------

This table summarizes each type of change, and whether it is considered a
non-breaking, schema versioning, or 
breaking change when made to the server-side App Services schema or the client-side
SDK object model. Schema versioning changes are considered breaking changes when
schema versioning is disabled.

.. tip:: Remap a Name Instead of Renaming

   Several Device SDKs support remapping a property or class name. Depending on
   your use case, you might choose to remap a name through the client code
   to avoid having to make a breaking change. For more information, refer to the :ref:`` section 

The following diagram shows the types of changes you can make and the 
process perform the change:

Data Model Changes
------------------ 

.. Examples on this page reference the following App Services schema for an ``Item`` object
.. type in a ``todo`` collection:

.. .. code-block:: json
..    :copyable: false

..    {
..     "bsonType": "object",
..     "properties": {
..       "_id": {
..         "bsonType": "objectId"
..       },
..       "isComplete": {
..         "bsonType": "bool"
..       },
..       "owner_id": {
..         "bsonType": "string"
..       },
..       "summary": {
..         "bsonType": "string"
..       }
..     },
..     "required": [
..       "_id",
..       "owner_id",
..       "summary",
..       "isComplete"
..     ],
..     "title": "Item"
..   }

.. .. _update-model-add-object-type:

.. Add an Object Type
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Adding an object type to your data model is always considered a non-breaking
.. change. This means that you can add a new object type to the server-side schema
.. or the client object model without any additional handling.

.. We add a new ``Project`` object type to our ``todo`` collection:

.. .. code-block:: json
..    :copyable: false

..    {
..     "bsonType": "object",
..     "properties": {
..       "_id": {
..         "bsonType": "objectId"
..       },
..       "isComplete": {
..         "bsonType": "bool"
..       },
..       "owner_id": {
..         "bsonType": "string"
..       },
..       "summary": {
..         "bsonType": "string"
..       }
..     },
..     "required": [
..       "_id",
..       "owner_id",
..       "summary",
..       "isComplete"
..     ],
..     "title": "Item"
..   }



.. - When Development Mode is enabled, you can add the object type to the SDK object
..   model, and Sync automatically handles the server-side schema updates.
.. - If schema versioning is enabled, you can add the object type to the server-side
..   schema, and Sync automatically handles the client-side SDK object model updates.
.. - manually add the object type to both the model and the schema.

.. .. note:: These changes may trigger a resync

..    When you add a new object type, we retrieve the documents for the
..    collection and re-insert them into App Services to get the new values. This
..    is expected behavior, but it does cause a temporary halt to propagating
..    changes while this process is underway.

.. .. _update-model-add-a-default-value:

.. Add a Default Value on a Property
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. You can add a default value on an object's required property. 

.. .. code-block:: json
..     :copyable: false
..     :emphasize-lines: 8

..   {
..     "bsonType": "object",
..     "properties": {
..       "_id": {
..         "bsonType": "objectId"
..       },
..       "isComplete": {
..         "bsonType": "bool",
..         "default": false
..       },
..       "owner_id": {
..         "bsonType": "string"
..       },
..       "summary": {
..         "bsonType": "string"
..       }
..     },
..     "required": [
..       "_id",
..       "owner_id",
..       "summary",
..       "isComplete"
..     ],
..     "title": "Item"
..   }


.. When you
.. insert an Atlas document missing this required property into the
.. collection, the SDK clients set the property to the default value. However,
.. the same property on the Atlas document remains empty until a client makes
.. changes to the property or updates the document directly in Atlas.

.. For more information on how default values are helpful when modifying
.. existing Atlas documents, see :ref:`<schema-update-add-required-property>`.

.. .. warning:: Ensure the default value type and property's type are the same

..    The default field does not have type validation. If the default field's type
..    and the property's type are not the same, the error will indicate that
..    the document is missing a required field.

.. .. _update-model-add-required-property:

.. Add a Required Property
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. You can add a required property to the client's object model, 
.. However, you should consider making the property optional to avoid the need to
.. modify existing Atlas documents.
.. - use :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` to let App Services infer the
.. server-side schema updates

.. - manually add the
.. required property to both the client model and the Atlas schema.



.. .. note:: Required Properties Missing in a Schema Subset Will Default to Zero

..    Clients can open the Realm with a schema subset that doesn't
..    include a required property. The server populates the
..    missing required value field with a zero or blank value
..    (like 0, "", or 0.0 depending on the property type) when the document syncs.

.. Modify Existing Atlas Documents
.. ```````````````````````````````

.. When you add a new required property, you must update existing documents with 
.. the new property or they do not sync to the client. This may give client 
.. users the impression that the data has been lost. Resolve this issue by
.. adding the new property to each impacted document and populating it with a 
.. value. After you update the documents to match the client schema, they 
.. sync to the client application.

.. When you add a new required property, App Services retrieves the documents for 
.. the collection that have new values per the updated schema. App Services iterates 
.. through those documents and re-inserts them to get the new values. This is
.. expected behavior, but it does cause a temporary halt to propagating changes 
.. while this process is underway.

.. .. important::

..    App Services uses a ``__realm_sync.unsynced_documents`` collection to track 
..    unsynced documents. When you add a required property, the re-sync process can 
..    push this collection over the limit of 100,000 documents. In this case, you must 
..    :ref:`terminate and re-enable sync <terminating-realm-sync>`, even though the 
..    change you're making is a non-breaking change. 

.. .. _update-model-add-optional-property:

.. Add an Optional Property
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. If you want to add an optional property to both the server-side schema and 
.. the client object model, you can add the optional property to the object 
.. model, and use :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` to let 
.. App Services infer the server-side schema updates. Or you can manually add the 
.. optional property to both the model and the schema.

.. .. note:: These changes may trigger a resync

..    When you add a new optional property, we retrieve the documents for the 
..    collection that have new values per the updated schema. We iterate 
..    through those documents and re-insert them into App Services to get 
..    the new values. This is expected behavior, but it does cause a temporary 
..    halt to propagating changes while this process is underway.

.. .. _update-model-remove-object-type:

.. Remove an Object Type
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. You can remove an object from the client's object model as a non-breaking change. 
.. If you remove the object from the server-side schema, it is a breaking change.
.. For this reason, we recommend you remove the object type from the client-side 
.. object model only and leave it in place on the server-side schema. 

.. .. _update-model-remove-property:

.. Remove a Property
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. You can remove an optional or required property from the client-side object model and 
.. leave it in place on the server-side schema. This is a 
.. non-breaking change to the object model.

.. If you remove a property from the server-side schema, it is a breaking change. 
.. For this reason, we recommend that you remove the property from the client-side 
.. object model only and leave it in place on the server-side schema. 

.. To maintain backward compatibility, removing a property from a client-side 
.. object model does not delete the property from the database. Instead, 
.. new objects retain the removed property, and App Services sets the value to an 
.. appropriate empty value, such as ``null`` for nullable properties, a 0 for 
.. integer values, or an empty string for string values. 

.. .. _update-model-change-property-status:

.. Change Whether a Property is Optional or Required
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Changing a property's status between optional and required 
.. is a breaking change to both the server-side schema and the client-side object model.

.. .. warning:: Update existing documents

..    If you change a property's status in the server-side schema, you must 
..    update existing documents with that new property type or they do not sync 
..    to the client. This may give client users the impression that the data 
..    has been lost.

.. Instead of changing a property's status, consider implementing the 
.. :ref:`partner collection strategy <schema-partner_collection-strategy>`, in which 
.. you keep the existing collection and schema, and create a new collection 
.. with the new schema. 

.. If you choose to change the property's status instead of using the partner collection 
.. strategy, you must terminate sync, manually update the schema, 
.. and re-enable sync. In addition, your client 
.. application must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` to restore Sync.
.. In the default client reset mode, the client attempts to recover any 
.. unsynced changes before resetting.

.. .. note::

..    :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` 
..    does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes. 

.. .. _update-model-change-property-type-but-keep-name:

.. Change the Data Type of a Property
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Changing a property's type is a breaking change to both the server-side 
.. schema and the client-side object model.

.. .. warning:: Update existing documents

..    If you change a property's type in the server-side schema, you must 
..    update existing documents with that new property type or they do not sync 
..    to the client. This may give client users the impression that the data 
..    has been lost.

.. Instead of changing a property's type, consider implementing the 
.. :ref:`partner collection strategy <schema-partner_collection-strategy>`, in which 
.. you keep the existing collection and schema, and create a new collection 
.. with the new schema. 

.. If you choose to change the property's type instead of using the partner collection 
.. strategy, you must terminate sync, manually update the schema, 
.. and re-enable sync. In addition, your client 
.. application must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` to restore Sync.
.. In the default client reset mode, the client attempts to recover any 
.. unsynced changes before resetting.

.. .. note::

..    :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` 
..    does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes. 

.. When you terminate and re-enable sync, you must also update existing Atlas 
.. documents to enable them to Sync with your client applications. 
.. Without this additional handling, those documents do not Sync and it may 
.. appear in the client that the data has been lost. You could resolve this issue 
.. in two ways:

.. - Change the old field type on each document to match the new schema
.. - Add a new field to each document with the type that matches the new schema, 
..   and copy the value from the old field into it, transforming its type

.. After you've made these changes, the appropriate documents should once again 
.. sync to the client application.

.. .. _update-model-change-object-type-name:

.. Rename an Object Type
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Changing an object's name on both the server-side schema and the client-side 
.. object model is a breaking change. However, some SDKs offer an API to 
.. map a new object name to an existing name in the schema. This allows you to 
.. rename an object on the client but not change the object name on the server. 
.. In this way, you avoid triggering a migration. Object name 
.. mapping is supported in the following SDKs:

.. - Kotlin
.. - Java
.. - .NET
.. - Flutter

.. If name mapping is not an option, consider implementing a  
.. :ref:`partner collection strategy <schema-partner_collection-strategy>`, in which 
.. you keep the existing collection and schema, and create a new collection 
.. with the new schema. 

.. If you choose to change the object's name instead of using the partner collection 
.. strategy, you must terminate sync, manually update the schema, 
.. and re-enable sync. In addition, your client 
.. application must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` to restore Sync.
.. In the default client reset mode, the client attempts to recover any 
.. unsynced changes before resetting.

.. To learn how, refer to the following SDK documentation:

..    - C++ SDK - not currently supported
..    - :ref:`Flutter SDK - Remap a Property or Class <flutter-map-property>`
..    - :ref:`Java SDK - Rename a Field or Class <java-rename-field>`

.. .. note::

..    :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` 
..    does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes.

.. .. warning:: Update existing documents

..    If you change a property name in the server-side schema, you must 
..    update existing documents with that new property name or they do not sync 
..    to the client. This may give client users the impression that the data 
..    has been lost.

.. If name mapping is not an option, consider implementing a

.. and re-enable sync. In addition, your client 
.. application must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` to restore Sync.
.. In the default client reset mode, the client attempts to recover any

.. When you terminate and re-enable sync, you must also update existing Atlas 
.. documents to enable them to Sync with your client applications. 
.. Without this additional handling, those documents do not Sync and it may 
.. appear in the client that the data has been lost. You could resolve this issue 
.. in two ways:

.. - Change the old field name on each document to match the new schema
.. - Add a new field to each document with a name that matches the new schema, 
..   and copy the value from the old field into it

.. After you've made these changes, the appropriate documents sync to the client 
.. application.

.. _schema-update-add-object-type:

Add an Object Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add an object type to either the server-side schema or the client 
object model without any additional handling. 

If you want to add an object type to both the server-side schema and the 
client object model, you can add the object type to the object model, and

When you add a new required property, App Services retrieves the documents for 
the collection that have new values per the updated schema. App Services iterates 
through those documents and re-inserts them to get the new values. This is
expected behavior, but it does cause a temporary halt to propagating changes 
while this process is underway.

.. important::

   App Services uses a ``__realm_sync.unsynced_documents`` collection to track 
   unsynced documents. When you add a required property, the re-sync process can 
   push this collection over the limit of 100,000 documents. In this case, you must 
   :ref:`terminate and re-enable sync <terminating-realm-sync>`, even though the 
   change you're making is a non-breaking change. 

.. _schema-update-add-optional-property:

Add an Optional Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to add an optional property to both the server-side schema and 
the client object model, you can add the optional property to the object 
model, and use :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` to let 
App Services infer the server-side schema updates. Or you can manually add the 
optional property to both the model and the schema.

.. note:: These changes may trigger a resync

   When you add a new optional property, we retrieve the documents for the 
   collection that have new values per the updated schema. We iterate 
   through those documents and re-insert them into App Services to get 
   the new values. This is expected behavior, but it does cause a temporary 
   halt to propagating changes while this process is underway.

.. _schema-update-remove-object-type:

Remove an Object Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remove an object from the client's object model as a non-breaking change. 
If you remove the object from the server-side schema, it is a breaking change.
For this reason, we recommend you remove the object type from the client-side 
object model only and leave it in place on the server-side schema. 

.. _schema-update-remove-property:

Remove a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remove an optional or required property from the client-side object model and 
leave it in place on the server-side schema. This is a 
non-breaking change to the object model.

If you remove a property from the server-side schema, it is a breaking change. 
For this reason, we recommend that you remove the property from the client-side 
object model only and leave it in place on the server-side schema. 

To maintain backward compatibility, removing a property from a client-side 
object model does not delete the property from the database. Instead, 
new objects retain the removed property, and App Services sets the value to an 
appropriate empty value, such as ``null`` for nullable properties, a 0 for 
integer values, or an empty string for string values. 

.. _schema-update-change-object-type-name:

Rename an Object Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changing an object's name on both the server-side schema and the client-side 
object model is a breaking change. However, some SDKs offer an API to 
map a new object name to an existing name in the schema. This allows you to 
rename an object on the client but not change the object name on the server. 
In this way, you avoid triggering a migration. Object name 
mapping is supported in the following SDKs:

- :ref:`Flutter SDK - Remap a Class <flutter-map-property>`
- :ref:`Java SDK - Rename a Class <java-rename-field>`
- :ref:`Kotlin SDK - Remap a Class <kotlin-remap-a-property>`
- :ref:`.NET SDK - Rename a Class <dotnet-rename-property>`
- :ref:`Node.js SDK - Remap a PClass <node-remap-a-property>`

.. TODO: Add RN once docs are updated in DOCSP-32466 
.. :ref:`React Native SDK - Remap a Property <react-native-remap-a-property>`

If name mapping is not an option, consider implementing a  
:ref:`partner collection strategy <schema-partner_collection-strategy>`, in which 
you keep the existing collection and schema, and create a new collection 
with the new schema. 

If you choose to change the object's name instead of using the partner collection 
strategy, you must terminate sync, manually update the schema, 
and re-enable sync. In addition, your client 
application must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` to restore Sync.
In the default client reset mode, the client attempts to recover any 
unsynced changes before resetting.

.. note::

   :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` 
   does not automatically update your schema for these changes. 

.. _schema-update-change-property-name:

Rename a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changing a property's name on both the server-side schema and the client-side 
object model is a breaking change. However, some SDKs offer an API to 
map a new property name to an existing name in the schema. This allows you to 
rename a property on the client but not change the property name on the server.

mapping is supported in the following SDKs:

- :ref:`Flutter SDK - Remap a Property <flutter-map-property>`
- :ref:`Java SDK - Rename a Field <java-rename-field>`
- :ref:`Kotlin SDK - Remap a Property <kotlin-remap-a-property>`
- :ref:`.NET SDK - Rename a Property <dotnet-rename-property>`

.. warning:: Update existing documents

   If you rename a property in the server-side schema, you must 
   update existing documents with that new property name or they do not sync 
   to the client. This may give client users the impression that the data 
   has been lost.

If name mapping is not an option, consider implementing a  
partner collection strategy, in which 
you keep the existing collection and schema, and create a new collection 
with the new schema. This strategy is described in the :ref:`schema-partner_collection-strategy` section on this page.

If you choose to change the property's name, you must terminate sync, manually update the schema, 
and re-enable sync. In addition, your client 
application must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` to restore Sync.
In the default client reset mode, the client attempts to recover any 
unsynced changes before resetting.

When you terminate and re-enable sync, you must also update existing Atlas 
documents to enable them to Sync with your client applications. 
Without this additional handling, those documents do not Sync and it may 
appear in the client that the data has been lost. You could resolve this issue 
in two ways:

- Change the old field name on each document to match the new schema
- Add a new field to each document with a name that matches the new schema, 
  and copy the value from the old field into it

After you've made these changes, the appropriate documents sync to the client 
application.

.. _schema-update-change-property-type-but-keep-name:

Change a Property Type but Keep the Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changing a property's type is a breaking change to both the server-side 
schema and the client-side object model.

  and copy the value from the old field into it, transforming its type

After you've made these changes, the appropriate documents should once again 
sync to the client application.

.. _schema-update-change-property-status:

Change a Property's Status Between Optional and Required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changing a property's status between optional and required 
is a breaking change to both the server-side schema and the client-side object model.

.. warning:: Update existing documents

   If you change a property's status in the server-side schema, you must 
   update existing documents with that new property type or they do not sync 
   to the client. This may give client users the impression that the data 
   has been lost.

Instead of changing a property's status, consider implementing the 
:ref:`partner collection strategy <schema-partner_collection-strategy>`, in which 
you keep the existing collection and schema, and create a new collection 
with the new schema.
