Overview
--------

When developing an application using Atlas Device Sync, you may need to make 
changes to the Device Sync data model that you initially created. For example,
you might need a new object type or decide that an optional property should be 
required.

In general, we discuss data model updates in the following terms: 

- *The type of change* 
  We broadly categorize changes to a Device Sync data model
  as being either breaking or non-breaking. Breaking changes, such as changing
  the data type of an existing property, are considered destructive and require
  additional handling to apply. Refer to the
  :ref:`breaking-and-non-breaking-changes` section on this page for more
  information. 

- *Where you are making the change* 
  Because the Device Sync data model consists of a client-side SDK object model
  and a server-side App Services schema, we distinguish between making changes
  to the client side (updating the SDK object models defined in your client
  code) or the server side (updating the collection schema through the App
  Services UI or Admin API). Regardles of where you make your
  changes, though, the end result must be that both
  sides reflect the changes to ensure clients can continue to sync data with
  Atlas. The implications of where you make your changes are discussed in more detail below.

- *Automatic or manual updates* 
  When possible, we recommend that apps use one of the following Device Sync
  features, which automatically handle applying breaking changes to your data
  model:  
  
  - Automatic Client-Side Updates with Development Mode: Apps with Development
    Mode enabled can make breaking changes from client code, and Device Sync
    automatically handles the updates to the server-side App Services schema.
    Apps must be created after September 13, 2023 and meet a minimum Device SDK
    version. For more information, refer to :ref:`update-data-model-development-mode`.
  - Automatic Server-Side Updates with Schema Versioning: Apps created after
    [DATE TBD], 2024 can make breaking changes to the server-side App Services
    schema. Device Sync creates a new schema version and automatically handles the
    updates to the client object models. For more information, refer to :ref:`update-data-model-production-apps`.

  Otherwise, you must manually update your data model. For more information, refer to :ref:`migrate-schema-partner-collection`.

.. _breaking-and-non-breaking-changes:

Breaking and Non-Breaking Changes
---------------------------------

**Non-breaking changes** are considered additive changes because they add new elements to your
data model. You can make these changes in your server-side App Services schema or in your
client-side SDK object model. No additional handling is required to apply these
changes.

**Breaking changes** are considered destructive changes because they modify
or remove elements in your data model. These changes require additional handling to apply, depending on
the type of breaking change, where you're making the breaking change, and
whether your app supports automatically handling breaking changes through
Development Mode or schema versioning: 

.. important:: All Changes are Breaking While Sync is Terminated

   You can :ref:`terminate and re-enable Device Sync <terminating-realm-sync>` in your app. However, if you update your data
   model while Device Sync is terminated, *all* changes that you make are
   considered breaking changes - even if they are normally categorized as
   non-breaking changes. 

Breaking Changes with Development Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Development Mode** is a Device Sync configuration setting that lets Sync
automatically infer and update the server-side App Services schema based on your
client-side changes - including breaking changes. 

When Development Mode is enabled in an eligible app*, you can make breaking changes to your client-side object model, and Device Sync automatically
applies the changes to your server-side schema.  
* (Your app must be created after September 13, 2023 and meet the minimum Device
SDK version, as noted in :ref:`<update-data-model-development-mode-prerequisites>`.)

To learn more, refer to :ref:`update-data-model-development-mode`.

For more information on Development Mode and how to enable it in your app, refer to :ref:`sync-settings`. 

.. include:: /includes/note-dev-mode-production.rst

Breaking Changes with Schema Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Schema versioning** is an App Services feature that lets you make breaking
changes to your server-side schema while an eligible app* is in production. 
App Services creates a new schema version with your changes and automatically
handles upgrading the client-side model to the new version.
* (Your app must be created after [DATE TBD], as noted in :ref:`<update-data-model-production-apps-prerequisites>`.)

You *cannot* use schema versioning in Development Mode. If you enable
Development Mode, then schema versioning is automatically disabled and any
version is cleared. When you disable Development Mode, schema
versioning is automatically re-enabled but any version history is unrecoverable.

- Non-breaking changes do *not* create a new schema version or write to the
  version history. Updates from
  non-breaking changes are always backward-compatible to the minimum allowed
  schema version.
- Breaking changes *always* create a new schema version, and the new version is
  either compatible or incompatible with previous versions:

  - **Compatible Breaking Changes:** Compatible breaking changes are changes that
    you can make to your server-side schema that are backward-compatible with
    previous schemas (to the earliest allowed schema version). 
  - **Incompatible Breaking Changes:** Incompatible breaking changes are
    changes that you can make to your server-side schema that are *not*
    backward-compatible with any previous schemas. An incompatible breaking change
    creates a new schema version that becomes the new earliest
    allowed schema version. All previous schemas are invalidated.

To learn more about schema versioning and how to make breaking changes with schema versioning, refer to
:ref:`update-data-model-production-apps`.

Manually Handle Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your app does not support making breaking changes with Development Mode or schema versioning, you must
manually apply breaking changes to your data model. 

For more information on how to manually apply breaking changes to your data
model, refer to :ref:`migrate-schema-partner-collection`.

.. tip:: Remap a Name Instead of Renaming

   Several Device SDKs support remapping a property or class name. Depending on
   your use case, renaming
   through the client code
   can be a convenient
   alternative to renaming your properties or classes. To learn how, refer to the following SDK documentation:

   - C++ SDK - not currently supported
   - :ref:`Flutter SDK - Remap a Property or Class <flutter-map-property>`
   - :ref:`Java SDK - Rename a Field or Class <java-rename-field>`
   - :ref:`Kotlin SDK - Remap a Property or Class <kotlin-remap-a-property>`
   - :ref:`.NET SDK - Rename a Property or Class <dotnet-rename-property>`
   - :ref:`Node.js SDK - Remap a Property or Class <node-remap-a-property>`
   - :ref:`React Native SDK - Remap a Property <react-native-remap-a-property>`
   - :ref:`Swift SDK - Remap a Property <swift-rename-property>`


Data Model Changes
------------------ 

The following sections provide more detailed information on how to make specific
changes to your Device Sync data model:

.. _update-model-add-object-type:

Add an Object Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a new object type to the server-side schema or the client
object model without any additional handling.

- If Development Mode is enabled, you can add the object type to the SDK object
  model, and Sync automatically handles the server-side schema updates.
- If schema versioning is enabled, you can add the object type to the server-side
  schema, and Sync automatically handles the client-side SDK object model updates.
- manually add the object type to both the model and the schema.

.. note:: These changes may trigger a resync

   When you add a new object type, we retrieve the documents for the
   collection and re-insert them into App Services to get the new values. This
   is expected behavior, but it does cause a temporary halt to propagating
   changes while this process is underway.

.. _update-model-add-a-default-value:

Add a Default Value on a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a default value on an object's required property. When you
insert an Atlas document missing this required property into the
collection, the Realm clients set the property to the default value. However,
the same property on the Atlas document remains empty until a client makes
changes to the property or updates the document directly in Atlas.

For more information on how default values are helpful when modifying
existing Atlas documents, see :ref:`<schema-update-add-required-property>`.

.. warning:: Ensure the default value type and property's type are the same

   The default field does not have type validation. If the default field's type
   and the property's type are not the same, the error will indicate that
   the document is missing a required field.

.. _update-model-add-required-property:

Add a Required Property
-----------------------

You can add a required property to the client's object model, and
use :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` to let App Services infer the
server-side schema updates. Or you can manually add the
required property to both the client model and the Atlas schema.
However, you should consider making the property optional to avoid the need to
modify existing Atlas documents.

.. note:: Required Properties Missing in a Schema Subset Will Default to Zero

   Clients can open the Realm with a schema subset that doesn't
   include a required property. The server populates the
   missing required value field with a zero or blank value
   (like 0, "", or 0.0 depending on the property type) when the document syncs.


Modify Existing Atlas Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you add a new required property, you must update existing documents with 
the new property or they do not sync to the client. This may give client 
users the impression that the data has been lost. Resolve this issue by
adding the new property to each impacted document and populating it with a 
value. After you update the documents to match the client schema, they 
sync to the client application.

When you add a new required property, App Services retrieves the documents for 
the collection that have new values per the updated schema. App Services iterates 
through those documents and re-inserts them to get the new values. This is
expected behavior, but it does cause a temporary halt to propagating changes 
while this process is underway.

.. important::

   App Services uses a ``__realm_sync.unsynced_documents`` collection to track 
   unsynced documents. When you add a required property, the re-sync process can 
   push this collection over the limit of 100,000 documents. In this case, you must 
   :ref:`terminate and re-enable sync <terminating-realm-sync>`, even though the 
   change you're making is a non-breaking change. 

.. _update-model-add-optional-property:

Add an Optional Property
------------------------

If you want to add an optional property to both the server-side schema and 
the client object model, you can add the optional property to the object 
model, and use :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` to let 
App Services infer the server-side schema updates. Or you can manually add the 
optional property to both the model and the schema.

.. note:: These changes may trigger a resync

   When you add a new optional property, we retrieve the documents for the 
   collection that have new values per the updated schema. We iterate 
   through those documents and re-insert them into App Services to get 
   the new values. This is expected behavior, but it does cause a temporary 
   halt to propagating changes while this process is underway.

Breaking Changes 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compatible Breaking Changes

.. _update-model-remove-object-type:

Remove an Object Type
---------------------

You can remove an object from the client's object model as a non-breaking change. 
If you remove the object from the server-side schema, it is a breaking change.
For this reason, we recommend you remove the object type from the client-side 
object model only and leave it in place on the server-side schema. 

.. _update-model-remove-property:

Remove a Property
-----------------
You can remove an optional or required property from the client-side object model and 
leave it in place on the server-side schema. This is a 
non-breaking change to the object model.

If you remove a property from the server-side schema, it is a breaking change. 
For this reason, we recommend that you remove the property from the client-side 
object model only and leave it in place on the server-side schema. 

To maintain backward compatibility, removing a property from a client-side 
object model does not delete the property from the database. Instead, 
new objects retain the removed property, and App Services sets the value to an 
appropriate empty value, such as ``null`` for nullable properties, a 0 for 
integer values, or an empty string for string values. 

.. _update-model-change-property-status:

Change a Property's Status Between Optional and Required
--------------------------------------------------------

Changing a property's status between optional and required 
is a breaking change to both the server-side schema and the client-side object model.

.. warning:: Update existing documents

   If you change a property's status in the server-side schema, you must 
   update existing documents with that new property type or they do not sync 
   to the client. This may give client users the impression that the data 
   has been lost.

Instead of changing a property's status, consider implementing the 
:ref:`partner collection strategy <schema-partner_collection-strategy>`, in which 
you keep the existing collection and schema, and create a new collection 
with the new schema. 

If you choose to change the property's status instead of using the partner collection 
strategy, you must terminate sync, manually update the schema, 
and re-enable sync. In addition, your client 
application must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` to restore Sync.
In the default client reset mode, the client attempts to recover any 
unsynced changes before resetting.

.. note::

   :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` 
   does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes. 

Incompatible Breaking Changes


.. _update-model-change-object-type-name:

Change an Object's Name
------------------------

Changing an object's name on both the server-side schema and the client-side 
object model is a breaking change. However, some SDKs offer an API to 
map a new object name to an existing name in the schema. This allows you to 
rename an object on the client but not change the object name on the server. 
In this way, you avoid triggering a migration. Object name 
mapping is supported in the following SDKs:

- Kotlin
- Java
- .NET
- Flutter

If name mapping is not an option, consider implementing a  
:ref:`partner collection strategy <schema-partner_collection-strategy>`, in which 
you keep the existing collection and schema, and create a new collection 
with the new schema. 

If you choose to change the object's name instead of using the partner collection 
strategy, you must terminate sync, manually update the schema, 
and re-enable sync. In addition, your client 
application must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` to restore Sync.
In the default client reset mode, the client attempts to recover any 
unsynced changes before resetting.

.. note::

   :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` 
   does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes. 

.. _update-model-change-property-name:

Change a Property Name
----------------------

Changing a property's name on both the server-side schema and the client-side 
object model is a breaking change. However, some SDKs offer an API to 
map a new property name to an existing name in the schema. This allows you to 
rename a property on the client but not change the property name on the server. 
In this way, you avoid triggering a migration. Property name 
mapping is supported in the following SDKs:

- :ref:`Flutter: Remap a Property <flutter-map-property>`
- :ref:`Java: Rename a Field <java-rename-field>`
- :ref:`Kotlin: Remap a Property <kotlin-remap-a-property>`
- :ref:`.NET: Rename a Property <dotnet-rename-property>`
- :ref:`Node.js: Remap a Property <node-remap-a-property>`
- :ref:`React Native: Remap a Property <react-native-remap-a-property>`
- :ref:`Swift: Remap a Property <swift-rename-property>`

.. warning:: Update existing documents

   If you change a property name in the server-side schema, you must 
   update existing documents with that new property name or they do not sync 
   to the client. This may give client users the impression that the data 
   has been lost.

If name mapping is not an option, consider implementing a  
partner collection strategy, in which 
you keep the existing collection and schema, and create a new collection 
with the new schema. 

If you choose to change the property's name instead of using the partner collection 
strategy, you must terminate sync, manually update the schema, 
and re-enable sync. In addition, your client 
application must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` to restore Sync.
In the default client reset mode, the client attempts to recover any 
unsynced changes before resetting.

When you terminate and re-enable sync, you must also update existing Atlas 
documents to enable them to Sync with your client applications. 
Without this additional handling, those documents do not Sync and it may 
appear in the client that the data has been lost. You could resolve this issue 
in two ways:

- Change the old field name on each document to match the new schema
- Add a new field to each document with a name that matches the new schema, 
  and copy the value from the old field into it

After you've made these changes, the appropriate documents sync to the client 
application.

.. _update-model-change-property-type-but-keep-name:

Change a Property Type but Keep the Name
----------------------------------------

Changing a property's type is a breaking change to both the server-side 
schema and the client-side object model.

.. warning:: Update existing documents

   If you change a property's type in the server-side schema, you must 
   update existing documents with that new property type or they do not sync 
   to the client. This may give client users the impression that the data 
   has been lost.

Instead of changing a property's type, consider implementing the 
:ref:`partner collection strategy <schema-partner_collection-strategy>`, in which 
you keep the existing collection and schema, and create a new collection 
with the new schema. 

If you choose to change the property's type instead of using the partner collection 
strategy, you must terminate sync, manually update the schema, 
and re-enable sync. In addition, your client 
application must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` to restore Sync.
In the default client reset mode, the client attempts to recover any 
unsynced changes before resetting.

.. note::

   :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` 
   does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes. 

When you terminate and re-enable sync, you must also update existing Atlas 
documents to enable them to Sync with your client applications. 
Without this additional handling, those documents do not Sync and it may 
appear in the client that the data has been lost. You could resolve this issue 
in two ways:

- Change the old field type on each document to match the new schema
- Add a new field to each document with the type that matches the new schema, 
  and copy the value from the old field into it, transforming its type

After you've made these changes, the appropriate documents should once again 
sync to the client application.
